## answer to reviewers for paper 97 ##

## Review 1 ##

We thank reviewer 1 for his very kind comments. 

We think the reviewer's remark on the parametrization we consider in section 3 is based on a misunderstanding.
This is a parametrization of Beta priors with the characteristic that the update step according to Bayes' Rule
is a shift in parameter space which only data-dependent, and thus the same for all priors (points) in the parameter space.
This property is convenient indeed as it preserves parameter set shapes, nevertheless the update of each prior
still is according to Bayes' Rule, so we do not incur any incoherences as was suspected by the reviewer.
We have added the words "according to Bayes' Rule" to the description of the parametrization (above equation 7)
in the hope to make this more clear.

On the remark about the contour function choice, the exponential contour function delivers a shape
that we motivate at the beginning of section 4. We chose it because it leads to simple expressions
for the contour derivatives and thus for the touchpoints of the boatset, and added a short note on this
at the start of section 4.1. We indeed remark in the conclusions section that other functional forms could be considered as well,
but we think a detailed discussion of the alternative mentioned there is out of scope for this paper.


## Review 2 ##

We thank reviewer 2 for his very kind comments. 


## Review 3 ##

We thank reviewer 3 for his very kind comments.

We had indeed submitted a paper with 14 pages as noted by the reviewer,
but were now able to trim it down to 12 pages***
