## answer to reviewers for paper 97 ##

## Review 1 ##

We thank reviewer 1 for his very kind comments. 

We think the reviewer's remark on the parametrization we consider in Section 3 is based on a misunderstanding.
This is a parametrization of Beta priors with the characteristic that the update step according to Bayes' Rule
is a shift in parameter space which is only data-dependent, and thus the same for all priors (points) in the parameter space.
This convenient property is at the core of our contribution as it preserves parameter set shapes,
nevertheless the update of each prior still is according to Bayes' Rule,
and so we do not incur any incoherences as was suspected by the reviewer.
We denote the update step now as "Bayes update step" in the hope to make this more clear,
see the line above Equation 6 (was Equation 7 in the first version) on page 5.

On the remark about the contour function choice, the exponential contour functions (Equation 7, page 6) deliver a shape
that we motivate at the beginning of section 4. We chose it because it leads to simple expressions
for the contour derivatives and so simplifies identification of the touchpoints.
We indeed remark in the conclusions section that other functional forms could be considered as well,
but we think a detailed discussion of the alternatives is out of scope for this paper.

We thank reviewer 2 for his very kind comments. 


## Review 3 ##

We thank reviewer 3 for his very kind comments.

We had indeed submitted a paper with 14 pages as noted by the reviewer,
but were now able to trim it down to 12 pages, mainly by shortening the somewhat lengthy introductory sections,
leaving to the parts describing our main findings untouched.
